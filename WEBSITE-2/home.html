            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as EduTech, or EdTech) is the combined use of computer hardware, software, and educational theory and practice to facilitate learning.</p>

              <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">What is Augmented reality?</h2>
              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.AR can be defined as a system that incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment). This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one.Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer-mediated reality.</p>

              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">With AR, classroom education can be extraordinary and more interactive, as AR can enable teachers to show virtual examples of concepts and add gaming elements to provide textbook material support. This will enable students to learn faster and memorize information.</p>

              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Augmented learning is an on-demand learning technique where the environment adapts to the learner. By providing remediation on-demand, learners can gain greater understanding of a topic while stimulating discovery and learning.<br>Augmented learning is closely related to augmented intelligence (intelligence amplification) and augmented reality. Augmented intelligence applies information processing capabilities to extend the processing capabilities of the human mind through distributed cognition. Augmented intelligence provides extra support for autonomous intelligence and has a long history of success</p>

              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">An API (Application Programming Interface) is essentially a gateway that allows software to talk to other software â€“ and also defines how that conversation takes place. This allows a programmer to write code to one software, that can then carry out certain desired actions, without a programmer having to write that software from scratch.</p>
