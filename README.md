# TRANSFORM-101
WEBSITE FOR EDUCATION SECTOR IN AR TECHNOLOGY


    TRANSFORM-101:   
            This Project has key focus on the education of young children and person you can communicate only with hands Once implemented it can help many students To learn visually with help of projection of the words or sentence with Help of AR technology This project requires only our website to be accessed which will be freely available.

   Using Symbol API we have created a logical code and implemented it into our website, And then we just  connected API to AR web extensions which are easily available, One such extension for AR/VR tech is GOOGLES WEBXR extension. This idea was mainly devoted on conversion of said words to the images associated with it. On further development we will try our best to convert the whole sentence into key elements of images For example: "TIGER " This word will grab image of tiger with help of symbl-API and project it with help of AR /VR Technology.
